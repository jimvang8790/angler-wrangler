Application Overview
--------------------
Angler Wrangler is a MEAN full-stack web application allowing anglers to track what type of fish they caught and where they caught it.. This application allows users to register an account and set-up a profile to log their catches. The application will utilize a Google Map API allowing anglers to mark where they caught their prize fish on the lake.  

On page load the DOM will have a username and password input fields. If they havenâ€™t register they can by clicking a register link to create an account. Once logged in users can add a new catch and enter the type of fish, size of the fish, weight of the fish, a photo of the fish, the lake they caught it at, and able to place a marker on the lake signifying the location of where they caught the fish.
